                <h3>New software - Old users</h3>
                <p>ISCAR's sophisticated computerized system provides direct control to the fully automatic CNC milling and turning machines. After many years, the interface and user experience became very old, not so friendly, and above all, not fulfilling
                    its efficiency potential. <br> Our project with Iscar was to create new software to improve productivity with demands for "low learning curve and high user adaptivity."</p>

                <h3>Understanding the production line</h3>
                <p>Our first task was getting to know the production line in high resolution. <br> To understand the entire chain and process on the floor before taking it to its next big step forward, we needed to: <br> 1. Learn the organization structure
                    <br> 2. Understand the organization needs and ambition <br> 3. Meet the employees and observe them at work with the machinery <br>

            <p class="main__IscarPlan-text fadeInRight wow">Our plan was based on deep organization research. <br> We, understood the complete picture of Iscar’s production line system <br> current status, it’s great powers, and it’s weaknesses. <br> Only at that stage we were able to sync and start
                to create, plan and <br> design the vision of it’s software future.</p>

                <h3> Mobile behavior <br> on computer monitor</h3>
                <p>The production line employees are working on stations with 19-inch monitors, and when we interviewed them, they requested that the new software will be "Very straightforward."</p>
                <p> Not too long after we started our persona and user research, our UX Director Hila Leizerovich recognized a very important common denominator. All employees are using android phones that were given to them by the company - So they are all
                    familiar with material design and feel comfortable with it.</p>
